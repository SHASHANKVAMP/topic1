    <h1>IoT Applications</h1>
    
     <p>
      Hello, my name is Shashank and i am student of Chitkara University persuing the course of software engineering. 
      I enjoy dancing, playing badminton, pretending to be a photographer, staying in touch with my friends, and laughing at funny things. 
      Would you mind saying hi?

      <p>
      Completed extremely interesting and advanced courses like Embedded System Development, and this semester we are studying the development of IOT applications.
      This assignment is a part of this unit, and it involves group activities and a practical assignment.
      </p>

     <h2 >Activity 1</h2>
    <p>
        In the first activity, we discussed a verbal knowledge in a group setting about IoT applications. We learned that IoT applications 
        are primarily used to analyze sensor data in the cloud and require the use of machine learning algorithms. The primary requirements 
        for IOT applications like smartphone apps for fitness trackers, smart homes, and industrial automation , 
        user interface, data processing, and artificial intelligence are The most important requirements for AI applications.
    </p>

    <h2 >Activity 2</h2>
    <p>
        IOT applications are more widely used as a result of the growing use of smart technology. In the second activity, 
        we discussed "smart builds," which refers specifically to a system that does not require any user interaction. 
        With the assistance of sensors like fire detection, lighting control system, earthquake detection, water level detection, 
        structural health detection, smart parking, and smart security, some of the primary features required for a smart building include 
        eco efficiency, high security, connecting building system, intelligent sensor IOT, augmented reality, data analytics, and automated processes.
     </p>

    <h2 >Activity 3</h2>
    <p>
        Our team went over every necessary point about smart parking during Activity 3, which was all about the control interface. AI-assisted parking management, light-directed parking, automated temperature control, a fire and smoke detection system, wireless charging, and a car lift are the high-level features of a smart parking facility. Following that, we have concentrated on the components required, such as a high-security camera system with a database to keep track of residents' parked cars, an anti-theft alarm, motion sensors and ultrasonic sensors, and LED lights to create light-directed parking.
        a temperature sensor to regulate the temperature of the parking lot.
